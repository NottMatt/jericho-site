                    This site serves as a testing ground for my journey learning webdev. 
                    Web development has been on the outside of my computer science education, and I thought that it was about time 
                    I branched out and experienced one of the most prevalent parts of the CS industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of beginning a colossal development and maintainance project with all the features I want,
                    I decided to start small and progressively implement new features in the HTML, CSS, and JS world as I learned about them.
                    I outlined an architecture where a tree of static webpages would contain organized "slates" relevant to the pages.
                    The whole vertically-stacked slate paradigm is one that I felt more simple sites should use. the three column design is useful for broad platforms, but less so for narrower windows.
                    Benefits of slates include the ability to easily dynamically generate them from JSON, as well as allow for mobile-friendly layout.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This, hopefully, will also become a place where I can collect tools and sites that I find useful or interesting, and share them with visitors.
                    Eventually I will implement features that allow for visitors to interact with the platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Education, Utility, and Fun really are the core tennets of my project here. Self hosting a site, laying the groundwork, following an architectural plan,
                     and progressively learning along the way are experiences that I think people from any background can benefit from, and my hope is that this experiment 
                     is one that more people begin to take up for themselves.
